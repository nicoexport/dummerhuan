  Insult: Your reputation precedes you, but they were way too kind, when they said
    how irrelevant you are.
  Responses:
  - "Your reputation said that you\u2019re an idiot - and they were right!"
  - "B-but they are still talking about me. That's a good thing, isn\u2019t it?"
  - At least they care about me. No one would ever care about your stupid face!
