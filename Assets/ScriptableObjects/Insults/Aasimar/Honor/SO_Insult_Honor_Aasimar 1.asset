  Insult: "Aren\u2019t you that person that thinks it has the moral high ground and
    therefore kills innocent people?"

  - I do not think I have the moral high ground. I do know better.
  - I think your perception of innocence is far off.
  - Whoever claimed them innocent are guilty as well. Therefore, I declare you guilty.
